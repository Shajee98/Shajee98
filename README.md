👋 Hi, I’m Shajee Waqar (@Shajee98)

I’m a software engineer specializing in web and mobile application development, with a strong understanding of the complete software development lifecycle — from requirement analysis and system design to implementation, testing, deployment, and automation. I focus on building scalable, maintainable, and performance-oriented applications using modern engineering best practices.

I’m proficient in the MERN stack and React Native, and have hands-on experience with a wide range of technologies including Next.js, NestJS, FastAPI, Python, Spring Boot, Quarkus, Docker, Kubernetes, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I’m comfortable working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure layers, and have experience integrating APIs, handling authentication and authorization, and optimizing systems for production environments.

I’m interested in collaborating on web, mobile, and AI-enabled application projects, particularly those that require thoughtful architecture and long-term scalability.
